## CSS Themes

SyntaxHighlighter 2.0 introduced custom CSS themes. This means that by switching out just one CSS file you 
can completely change the look and feel of the highlighted syntax. A small number of popular color themes 
are included with SyntaxHighlighter and you can easily make your own.
