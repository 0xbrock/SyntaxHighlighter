## Printing <span class="version only">1.5</span><span class="version only">2.x</span>

SyntaxHighlighter can print its formatted output without including surrounding page content. This functionality is available from the toolbar if it hasn't been disabled. 

## Theme

When printing, current theme is ignored and a simplified white theme is used without any background colors. This theme is defined in the main [shCore.css](files/shcore.css.html) file with the <code>.printing</code> class.
