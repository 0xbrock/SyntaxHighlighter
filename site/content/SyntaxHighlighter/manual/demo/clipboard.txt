## Clipboard Feature <span class="version only">1.5</span> <span class="version only">2.x</span>

SyntaxHighlighter provides ability to copy original source code to the user's clipboard. This 
functionality is available from the toolbar if it hasn't been disabled. 

## Technical details

This functionality works on Internet Explorer by default and requires a flash hack to work on 
all other browsers. SyntaxHighlighter ships with a very small SWF file that is loaded in the 
toolbar and looks like another icon. 

You have to [configure](configuration/) SyntaxHighlighter via the `clipboardSwf` configuration 
property.
