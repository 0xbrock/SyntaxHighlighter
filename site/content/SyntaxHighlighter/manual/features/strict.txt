## XHTML Strict

SyntaxHighlighter 2.0 is now 100% standards compliant. Not only the source <code>&lt;pre /></code> tags pass XHTML strict, but the actual output generated by SyntaxHighlighter is 100% valid. 

__Note__: Firefox Web Developer addon doesn't send incorrect HTML to W3C validation when using its Tools / Validate Local HTML functionality. It seems to be <i>unescaping</i> HTML characters.
