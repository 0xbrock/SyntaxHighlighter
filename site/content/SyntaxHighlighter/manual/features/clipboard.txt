## Clipboard Feature

SyntaxHighlighter provides ability to copy original source code to the user's clipboard. This functionality is available from the toolbar if it hasn't been disabled. 

## Technical details

This functionality works on Internet Explorer by default and requires a flash hack to work on all other browsers. SyntaxHighlighter ships with a very small SWF file that is loaded in the toolbar and looks like another icon. 

You have to [configure](configuration.html) SyntaxHighlighter via the <code>clipboardSwf</code> configuration property.
