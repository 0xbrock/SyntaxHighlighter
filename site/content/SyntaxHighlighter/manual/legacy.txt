## SyntaxHighlighter History

SyntaxHighlighter project originally started in 2004 by [Alex Gorbatchev](about.html) and has evolved ever since. The project has seen some great success and have gained a few big name users over the years. From the start it was an open source project and while the core code has seen few contributions and was mostly maintained by [Alex Gorbatchev](about.html), there's been a number of [brushes](brushes.html) contributed. 

## SyntaxHighlighter 2.0

New 2.0 version is a near 100% rewrite of the 1.5 and is backwards compatible with 1.5 via the <code>[shLegacy.js](files/shlegacy.js.html)</code> addon. The two new major features are [themes](themes.html) and [HTML script](demo/html-script.html). 

## SyntaxHighlighter 1.5

The original SyntaxHighlighter is still hosted on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/), however it's no longer an active project.
