## Introduction

__SyntaxHighlighter__ is a fully functional self-contained [code syntax highlighter][1] developed in [JavaScript][2].
To get an idea of what SyntaxHighlighter is capable of, have a look at the [demo page](manual/demo).

The project was started in 2004 and since then has [gained a lot of acceptance](spotlight.html). Version 2.0 
is the new page in history of the project representing a near complete rewrite, clean up, optimization, 
standard compliance and new features.
