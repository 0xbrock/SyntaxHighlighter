## Hosting

If you are using a hosted service (like Blogger), and don't have a place to upload SyntaxHighlighter code, 
there's a **hosted version** available. This wiki is using hosted files as a "proof of concept." 

[there is a good post explaining how to install on blogger is here](http://blog.cartercole.com/2009/10/awesome-syntax-highlighting-made-easy.html) 
it also has a cool widget to preview the different themes

## Details

The location of hosted files is `http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/\[VERSION]`. You can see all available hosted 
versions [here](http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/). Whenever a new version is published, the older version will 
remain untouched.

## Legacy 1.5.1 hosting

Old 1.5.1 version is available as well at this location: [http://alexgorbatchev.com/pub/sh/1.5.1](/pub/sh/1.5.1).
