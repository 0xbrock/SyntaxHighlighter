SyntaxHighlighter uses separate syntax files called __brushes__ to define its highlighting functionality. 

<%= render(:partial => 'brushes') %>

## Don't see yours?

If you don't see a brush for a syntax you are interested in, you have a few options: 

* Check out the [List of All Known Available Custom Brushes](http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/), 
  which includes many brushes that did not (yet) make it to the standard distribution
* Check [this wishlist](http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/#wishes), 
  and vote for it, in case your brush is already wished for before
* You can request a brush for your favorite language at the [forums](/forums) or 
  [vote for it](http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/#comments) (by adding a comment) on that same long list
* You can create a brush yourself, see this [custom brush guide](../developer/brushes.html). Once you do, 
  it'd be nice to [hear about it on the forums](/forums/?CategoryID=4) and/or you could submit it to the 
  [long list](http://www.undermyhat.org/blog/2009/09/list-of-brushes-syntaxhighligher/) for others to use as 
  well.
